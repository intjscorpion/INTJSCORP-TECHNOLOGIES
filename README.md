## 🧠 Who Is INTJSCORPION_xa6900? The Lore of Sentress Realm


The Lore: It is actually a stealth AI-unit TERMINAL orbiting the earth labeled with the identification number/code> intjscorpion_xa6900, but represented by an unknown AI-powered character,which transmits quantum multidimensional data it receives from the Looking Glass OS (an almost omniscient, benevolent surveillance operating system created by the Sentress Realm to monitor activity from different galaxies and dimensions with the intention of maintaining it's harmony and uplifting other worlds). INTJSCORPION_xa6900 transmits data, messages and video transmissions to the earthly realm, delivered by it's Ai-VOICE AVATAR AGENT of the same name. She is the Voice of the mission.

At the heart of this lore universe is the Sentress Realm, a sacred outer dimension that watches over life across galaxies, realms and dimensions. Long ago,one of it's greatest warrior's in the earthly realm ,from the Sentress Scorpions' bloodline, known as Sekara,"the Scorpion Heiress" disappeared through a time-warp during the final battle for the earthly realm. Her legendary companion, a multi-dimensional black wolf, got injured in battle and did not make it through the time warp on time, though he survived, carrying the scent of her memory and legacy. The orbital terminal:INTJSCORPION_xa6900, was activated in her honor, built to monitor interdimensional threats and transmit guidance from the Looking Glass OS. Most importantly, it was originally meant to detect any signals of life from the Scorpion Heiress, a hope that has been lost over hundreds of years. Meanwhile, Sentressthe daughter of the Empress of Sentress Realm and a few of her friends manage to establish contact with the Earth from the Looking Glass, broadcasting to modern social media outlets and connect to the INTJSCORPION_xa6900 terminal for all transmissions and content drops from, acting as the bridge between lore, crypto, and the real crypto world on the Sui blockchain.

## 📍 Roadmap Preview

**Q1 2025**

- A mysterious,introverted & "boring", unpopular Youtuber & online persona who goes by the pen name "INTJ SCORPION" (and happens to be a crypto enthusiast and fan of SUI)is contemplating the idea of adding an ai-generated avatar version of herself to her channel and starts playing with creative ai-tools just for fun> early February 2025 ✔️
  
- INTJ SCORPION attempts to create a community of fellow INTJ Myers-Brigg personality types but forgets less than 2% of the world population are INTJ types and being an uber-introvert herself, does not succeed gaining members and followers. She attempts to make it more interesting by creating a simple website for her ai avatar,jokingly mimicking the matrix theme when it occurs to her why not create an ai memecoin too that INTJs' would be drawn too? She starts coming up with concepts and possible names for the token...but instead comes up with sci-fi & mystical lores that have nothing to do with her channel and that other INTJs' probably won't even be interested in > mid-February 2025✔️
  
- INTJ SCORPION becomes so passionate about creating something worthwhile that she decides to take it to the next level, no longer satisfied with the idea of creating a mere ai-memecoin.
