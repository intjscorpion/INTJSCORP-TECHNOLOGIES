## 📍 Roadmap Preview

**Q1 2025**

- A mysterious,introverted & "boring", unpopular Youtuber & online persona who goes by the pen name "INTJ SCORPION" (who happens to be a crypto enthusiast and fan of SUI)is contemplating the idea of adding an ai-generated avatar version of herself to her channel and starts playing with creative ai-tools just for fun> early February 2025 ✔️
  
- INTJ SCORPION attempts to create a community of fellow INTJ Myers-Brigg personality types but forgets less than 2% of the world population are INTJ types and being an uber-introvert herself, does not succeed gaining members and followers.
