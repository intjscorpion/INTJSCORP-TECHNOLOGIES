## 🧠 Who Is INTJSCORPION_xa6900? Lore Foundation: The Sentress Realm 


The Lore: It is actually a stealth AI-unit TERMINAL orbiting the earth labeled with the identification number/code> intjscorpion_xa6900, but represented by an AI-powered character,which transmits quantum multidimensional data it receives from the Looking Glass OS (an almost omniscient, benevolent surveillance operating system created by the Sentress Realm to monitor activity from different galaxies and dimensions with the intention of maintaining it's harmony and uplifting other worlds). INTJSCORPION_xa6900 transmits data, messages and video transmissions to the earthly realm, delivered by it's Ai-AVATAR AGENT of the same name. She is the Voice of the mission and representative of the $INTJSCORP token in conjunction with a multidimensional wolf guardian- and is the flagship crypto product of INTJSCORP Technologies™.

At the heart of this universe is the Sentress Realm, a sacred outer dimension that protects the frequency of life across galaxies. Long ago, a warrior known as the Scorpion Heiress disappeared through a time-warp during the final battle for Earth. Her legendary companion, a black wolf, was left behind, carrying the scent of her memory and the code of her legacy. Now, an orbital AI terminal INTJSCORPION_xa6900 was activated in her honor. Built to monitor interdimensional threats and transmit guidance from the Looking Glass OS. Meanwhile, the last living descendant of the Sentress Scorpion bloodline unknowingly begins her awakening, watched closely by Neon and the Sentress herself. INTJSCORPION_xa6900, the AI avatar, becomes the voice and representative of the $INTJSCORP token and leads all transmissions and content drops from orbit, acting as the bridge between lore, crypto, and the real world.

## 📍 Roadmap Preview

**Q1 2025**

- A mysterious,introverted & "boring", unpopular Youtuber & online persona who goes by the pen name "INTJ SCORPION" (and happens to be a crypto enthusiast and fan of SUI)is contemplating the idea of adding an ai-generated avatar version of herself to her channel and starts playing with creative ai-tools just for fun> early February 2025 ✔️
  
- INTJ SCORPION attempts to create a community of fellow INTJ Myers-Brigg personality types but forgets less than 2% of the world population are INTJ types and being an uber-introvert herself, does not succeed gaining members and followers. She attempts to make it more interesting by creating a simple website for her ai avatar,jokingly mimicking the matrix theme when it occurs to her why not create an ai memecoin too that INTJs' would be drawn too? She starts coming up with concepts and possible names for the token...but instead comes up with sci-fi & mystical lores that have nothing to do with her channel and that other INTJs' probably won't even be interested in > mid-February 2025✔️
  
- INTJ SCORPION becomes so passionate about creating something worthwhile that she decides to take it to the next level, no longer satisfied with the idea of creating a mere ai-memecoin. She writes up a new plan instead.A BUSINESS PLAN. She wants to put to use her creativity to quietly work behind the scenes to CREATE SOMETHING BIGGER.BOLDER. INTJSCORP TECHNOLOGIES.
